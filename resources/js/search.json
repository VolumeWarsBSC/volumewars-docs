Users participate by buying their projects’ token and sending it to the burn address. Gain experience points, NFTs and do damage on the blockchain to opposing projects to compete for the prize top prize, a massive buy-back and burn for any project that wins. Fun, friendly and fair competitions that benefit every project that uses it."]},{"i":"what-is-volumewars","l":"What is VolumeWars?","p":["Volume Wars has been created as a solution for a growing problem, competition between projects on the blockchain. The task for us was simple, create something that would bring the thousands of competing DeFi tokens all together to boost volume and price action for each project. DeFi tokens are special and unique in that they have something called the magic of tokenomics. Volume Wars is THE game to motivate those tokenomics and benefit all of DeFi as a whole. #LiftingUp"]},{"i":"calling-all-volume","l":"Calling all volume!","p":["“Give me volume or give me paper hands”— degens","So why exactly did we call it VOLUME wars, and why is volume so important? In order to understand this question, we first need to back up and ask what are tokenomics? The magic of DeFi uses a suite of services via ‘tokenomics’ that actuate during the events of volume. In simple terms, with every buy, sell, transfer and borrow/lend each of these events stand to generate an amount of volume that is then subjected to a protocol fee. This protocol fee is the mechanism used to carry over rewards toward protocol growth and sustainability as an incentive for holders. Therefore the following inevitably applies throughout DeFi:","NO volume = NO tokenomics = Slow death spiral"]}],[{"l":"The Game","p":["Upon navigating to https://volumewars.app, the first step will be to join your team. It is important to understand that each team on volume wars is a project with their own token on Binance Smart Chain. Note that you there is no requirement to join any team, but after your selection you will not be able to switch teams, so choose wisely! A team selection will require a small amount of gas to complete a one-time transaction.","Now for the fun part. To attack a team, the user must select both the opposing team for a target as well as the amount of damage points to be used for the attack. More damage points cost more BNB to attack, however higher damage also yields a higher percentage of chance for reward as well as additional experience points earned. Upon attack completion, the user will be awarded 1 booster pack.","As described previously, higher damage yields higher rewards generated as booster packs. Booster packs are unique to volume wars and contain one of several substrate NFTs that, when combined together, allow the user to obtain BNB captured within the game. The opportunity to collect and trade these NFTs within the ecosystem to complete the set is the overall objective to fully capture this value potential within Volume Wars.","Volume Wars booster packs use Chainlink VRF by calling function fulfillRandomness yielding a random number from the smart contract. This random number is indicative of the players chance at receiving 1 of 3 rare NFTs. Chainlink VRF is widely considered as an industry standard in randomness on the blockchain. You can read more about it on their website at https://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-vrf/. Note that there NFTs are limited by season, and there can only be a collection of 4 common NFTs and 3 rare NFTs per season. This means that as soon as the season is closed, there will be no more NFTs granted from participation for that season. This limits the amount of NFTs that can be forged into a legendary NFT per season.","If you are lucky enough to get all 7 of the NFTs, you can now forge your legendary! Forging a legendary takes the set of 7 NFTs and burns them to mint one legendary which allows the user to claim the rewards by staking this legendary on our UI to capture these rewards generated each season.","IMPORTANT: NFTs MUST BE FROM THE SAME SEASON TO MINT A LEGENDARY, YOU CANNOT MIX NFTS ACROSS MULTIPLE SEASONS TO MINT A LEGENDARY."]},{"l":"Examples","p":["0 rare NFT #6 from season 3","1 common NFT #1 from season 2","1 common NFT #1 from season 3","1 common NFT #2 from season 3","1 common NFT #3 from season 1","1 common NFT #3 from season 3","1 common NFT #4 from season 3","1 rare NFT #5 from season 3","1 rare NFT #5 from season 4","1 rare NFT #6 from season 3","1 rare NFT #7 from season 2","1 rare NFT #7 from season 3","3 rare NFT #7 from season 3","4 common NFT #3 from season 3","5 common NFT #2 from season 3","5 common NFT #4 from season 3","9 common NFT #1 from season 3","9 rare NFT #5 from season 3","Here are some examples for when a player may forge a legendary NFT:","Player 1 has the following NFTs in their possession","Player 2 has the following NFTs in their possession:","Player 3 has the following NFTs in their possession:","This player can forge a legendary NFT for season 3.","This player cannot forge a legendary NFT."]}],[{"l":"Game Mechanics","p":["Volume Wars is designed to provide the most rewards the early adopters. To achieve this we need to adjust the game variables using reward chance and prize pool percentage allocation. Currently these rewards are set at certain amounts, approximately 7.2 BNB per legendary, but this number will increase over time while remaining sensitive toward adoption of the protocol.","Remember, total rewards for legendary NFT holders is dependent on volume divided by the total legendary NFTs in circulation. Regarding this, our long term planning is to set our variables that allow for at least 1 legendary NFT to be minted per season. Of course this proposition is subjective towards seasonal volume as these NFTs are dropped based upon BNB spent. So starting out we have implemented a percentage decrease in the odds to obtain a legendary NFT as adjusted weekly and influenced by protocol volume.","Note that each season is open for a period of one week."]},{"l":"Examples","p":["1:20 odds per rare dropped @ 0.12 BNB per attack","1:22 odds per rare dropped @ 0.12 BNB per attack","1:24 odds per rare dropped @ 0.12 BNB per attack","1:27 odds per rare dropped @ 0.12 BNB per attack","1:28 odds per rare dropped @ 0.12 BNB per attack","1:29 odds per rare dropped @ 0.12 BNB per attack","1:30 odds per rare dropped @ 0.12 BNB per attack","1:34 odds per rare dropped @ 0.12 BNB per attack","1:39 odds per rare dropped @ 0.12 BNB per attack","1:45 odds per rare dropped @ 0.12 BNB per attack","1:55 odds per rare dropped @ 0.12 BNB per attack","1:68 odds per rare dropped @ 0.12 BNB per attack","etc...","If 100 BNB volume per week then chance to obtain a legendary decreases by 20% the current rate every week until it is only possible to obtain 1 legendary NFT dropped during the season.","If 25 BNB volume per week then then chance to obtain a legendary decrease by 50% the current rate every week until it is only possible to obtain 1 legendary NFT dropped during the season.","If 50 BNB volume per week then chance to obtain a legendary decreases by 40% the current rate every week until it is only possible to obtain 1 legendary NFT dropped during the season.","If more than 100 BNB volume per week then chance to obtain a legendary decrease by 10% the current rate every week until it is only possible to obtain 1 legendary NFT dropped during the season.","It is possible that the sudden change in volume from week to week could influence our decision to increase or decrease the rewards as necessary. We aim to hand this power over to a DAO in the future."]}],[{"l":"Gameplay Model"},{"l":"Fair Gameplay Strategy","p":["Weighted teams wont matter. Fair gameplay with Volume Wars involves a mechanic in which the team with the LEAST amount of damage taken wins. This promotes healthy competition and here’s why:","A big project wants to dominate Volume Wars. They enter the game and their holder count is massive and start wrecking every other team. Now the other teams must combine attacks against the big player to stand a chance. This involves a coordinated effort between the ‘weaker’ projects to take down the big player.","This time two big players enter Volume Wars and decide they want to work together to destroy all of the other teams. In this scenario the weaker teams MUST coordinate strategy against the two big players. The weaker teams secretly agree to hold off on their attacks to fool the bigger teams into thinking that the weaker projects won’t even put up a fight. Eventually thinking they are much too far in the lead, the big teams start attacking each other. It is at the last minute the weak teams unleash fury and catch the big players off guard to tip the scales back in their direction."]},{"l":"Early Adopters Incentive","p":["As mentioned in the game mechanics before, VolumeWars is designed to incentivize early adopters. Therefore:","First users to participate will receive an increased chance at obtaining a legendary NFT. This percentage of odds will diminish over time.","Free entry for token developers to become a featured project on Volume Wars to start. As volume Wars gains popularity there could be a fee upon entry.","First participants will have the earliest opportunity to earn more BNB captured from the game because rewards is dependent on # of legendary NFTs staked"]}],[{"l":"Experience Points","p":["Coming Soon..."]}],[{"l":"NFTs","p":["Volume Wars rewards its participants with NFT Booster Packs, these can be claimed at the NFT Locker","After claiming these booster packs, users must unwrap the booster packs to mint their NFTs. These NFTs range from common to rare. There are 4 common cards and 3 rare cards to complete a set.","Common NFT","Players can play VolumeWars and attempt to collect the set themselves or they can buy the missing NFTs to complete their set from a 3rd party marketplace.","Once a complete set is made, the user can then choose to forge their set into a Legendary NFT.","Legendary NFT"]},{"l":"NFT Staking","p":["Legendary NFTs can be staked to collect BNB rewards generated by the other players participating in Volume Wars. These BNB rewards generated are taken from fees per attack from all users who play the game.","Legendary NFTs Stakers can collect their rewards using the claim button on the dashboard after each season has concluded, and can buy and sell their legendary NFT on our markplace."]}],[{"l":"NFT Marketplace","p":["Volume Wars has its own native NFT marketplace that users may use to buy or sell. To list your NFT simply navigate to the NFT collection page and select sell, set your price and submit. Your NFT will be featured amongst those for sale and displayed for all other players in the order of lowest price available for that type of NFT.","Please note, because there is unlimited amount of common NFTs with no use cases yet (hint, hint) we decided to exclude them from being bought or sold at this time. Rest assured the developers are brainstorming new uses for common NFTs, and as these use cases are added we will be sure to add commons to the marketplace."]},{"l":"Marketplace Fee","p":["Volume Wars marketplace fee is currently set to 10% per each transaction. This fee is currently used to buy and burn Piggy Bank Tokens. This fee and its use may be subject to change in the future. The overall objective going forward is to allow the community to decide how this fee should be implemented with a governance mechanism, otherwise known as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). The implementation and timeline of this DAO is still under construction."]}],[{"l":"Links","p":["Audit Website Twitter"]}]]
