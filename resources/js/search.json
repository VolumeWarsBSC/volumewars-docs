Users participate by buying their projects’ token and sending it to the burn address. Gain experience points, NFTs and do damage on the blockchain to opposing projects to compete for the prize top prize, a massive buy-back and burn for any project that wins. Fun, friendly and fair competitions that benefit every project that uses it."]},{"i":"what-is-volumewars","l":"What is VolumeWars?","p":["Volume Wars has been created as a solution for a growing problem, competition between projects on the blockchain.","Our task was to create a game that would bring thousands of competing DeFi tokens together, channeling the strength of their communities into a battle for volume, boosting volume and price action for all participants.","DeFi tokens are special and unique in that they have something called the magic of tokenomics. Volume Wars is THE game to motivate those tokenomics and benefit all of DeFi as a whole. #LiftingUp"]},{"i":"calling-all-volume","l":"Calling all volume!","p":["“Give me volume or give me paper hands”— degens","So why exactly did we call it VOLUME wars, and why is volume so important? In order to understand this question, we first need to back up and ask what are tokenomics?","The magic of DeFi uses a suite of services via ‘tokenomics’ that actuate during the events of volume. In simple terms, with every buy, sell, transfer and borrow/lend each of these events stand to generate an amount of volume that is then subjected to a protocol fee.","This protocol fee is the mechanism used to carry over rewards towards protocol growth and sustainability as an incentive for holders. Therefore the following inevitably applies throughout DeFi:","NO volume = NO tokenomics = Slow death spiral"]}],[{"l":"The Game","p":["Upon navigating to https://volumewars.app, the first step is to pick and join a team. Each team on Volume Wars is a project with their own token on Binance Smart Chain. Switching teams afterwards is not allowed, so choose wisely! The team selection requires submitting a transaction, which will cost a small amount of gas.","Now for the fun part. First, select the team you want to attack. Second, choose the size of your attack in BNB: There are four attack tiers, which are based on the amount of BNB you will spend when choosing them.","Your enemy receives Damage Points equivalent to the BNB you spent, while you earn the same amount in experience points (XP). You will receive a booster pack corresponding to the tier of your attack. The higher the tier, the greater the rewards they yield. Tier 1 booster packs have the lowest rewards, Tier 4 the highest. You will always receive a booster pack, but not all packs contain rewards.","Higher damage yields higher rewards generated as higher tier booster packs. Booster packs are unique to volume wars and contain one of several substrate NFTs that, when combined together, allow the user to obtain BNB captured within the game. The opportunity to collect and trade these NFTs within the ecosystem to complete the set is the overall objective to fully capture this value potential within Volume Wars.","Once you earn booster packs by playing the game, you must \"claim\" them before being able to open them. This is a two step process. After claiming, you will have to wait a few minutes before automatically receiving your claimed packs back, which are then ready to be opened.","We leverage Chainlink's VRF to generate random numbers for the rewards. The way the random numbers are selected inherently requires two transactions for security reasons, which is why the process happens in two steps, claiming, and opening. Learn more about it through their documentation: https://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-vrf/","There is a fee for claiming, which is paid to the Chainlink VRF contract. All current unclaimed boosters are processed together in a single transaction, and the fee you pay does not change depending on the number of packs included in it. In order to reduce your costs you can wait until you have many booster packs before claiming them.","Chainlink VRF is widely considered as an industry standard in randomness on the blockchain.","Once the next season starts, minting NFTs from previous seasons becomes impossible. If you have unopened or unclaimed booster packs, these will always mint NFTs from the current season regardless of when the booster packs were obtained.","The only exception is Legendaries. Legendaries from previous seasons can be forged after their season has ended, however they require you to own the full set of NFTs from the season they are from. Hence, they are limited by the number of rare and common NFTs minted during that season.","Once you complete a particular season's set of 7 NFTs, you can sacrifice them to forge that season's Legendary. This requires one of each of the 4 common and 3 rare cards from the same season.","Legendaries can be staked, receiving BNB rewards corresponding to a portion of each future season's revenue. After 52 seasons (counted from the Legendary's own season), they expire, and no longer receive rewards. Expired Legendary NFTs are automatically unstaked.","IMPORTANT: YOU CANNOT MIX NFTS ACROSS MULTIPLE SEASONS TO MINT A LEGENDARY. YOU NEED TO OWN THE FULL SET FROM A PARTICULAR SEASON"]},{"l":"Examples","p":["0 rare NFT #6 from season 3","1 common NFT #1 from season 2","1 common NFT #1 from season 3","1 common NFT #2 from season 3","1 common NFT #3 from season 1","1 common NFT #3 from season 3","1 common NFT #4 from season 3","1 rare NFT #5 from season 3","1 rare NFT #5 from season 4","1 rare NFT #6 from season 3","1 rare NFT #7 from season 2","1 rare NFT #7 from season 3","3 rare NFT #7 from season 3","4 common NFT #3 from season 3","5 common NFT #2 from season 3","5 common NFT #4 from season 3","9 common NFT #1 from season 3","9 rare NFT #5 from season 3","Here are some examples for when a player may forge a legendary NFT:","Player 1 has the following NFTs in their possession","Player 2 has the following NFTs in their possession:","Player 3 has the following NFTs in their possession:","This player can forge a legendary NFT for season 3.","This player cannot forge a legendary NFT."]}],[{"l":"Gameplay Model"},{"l":"Fair Gameplay Strategy","p":["Weighted teams wont matter. Fair gameplay with Volume Wars involves a mechanic in which the team with the LEAST amount of damage taken wins. This promotes healthy competition and here’s why:","A big project wants to dominate Volume Wars. They enter the game and their holder count is massive and start wrecking every other team. Now the other teams must combine attacks against the big player to stand a chance. This involves a coordinated effort between the ‘weaker’ projects to take down the big player.","This time two big players enter Volume Wars and decide they want to work together to destroy all of the other teams. In this scenario the weaker teams MUST coordinate strategy against the two big players. The weaker teams secretly agree to hold off on their attacks to fool the bigger teams into thinking that the weaker projects won’t even put up a fight. Eventually thinking they are much too far in the lead, the big teams start attacking each other. It is at the last minute the weak teams unleash fury and catch the big players off guard to tip the scales back in their direction."]},{"l":"Early Adopters Incentive","p":["As mentioned in the game mechanics before, VolumeWars is designed to incentivize early adopters. Therefore:","Early participants will benefit from the intially higher chances of obtaining a Legendary NFT. The odds of obtaining one will decrease over time.","Free entry for token developers to become a featured project on Volume Wars to start. As volume Wars gains popularity this might involve a fee.","Early Legendary NFT holders will have the opportunity to earn a larger slice of the BNB captured from the game because rewards are divided equally between staked Legendaries, which will increase in number."]}],[{"l":"Experience Points","p":["Coming Soon..."]}],[{"l":"NFTs","p":["Volume Wars rewards its participants with NFT Booster Packs, these can be claimed at the NFT Locker","After claiming these booster packs, users must unwrap the booster packs to mint their NFTs. These NFTs range from common to rare. There are 4 common cards and 3 rare cards to complete a set.","Players can play VolumeWars and attempt to collect a full set themselves or they can buy the missing NFTs to complete their set from a 3rd party marketplace.","Once a season's set is completed, it can be forged into a Legendary NFT."]},{"l":"NFT Staking","p":["Legendary NFTs can be staked to collect BNB rewards generated by the other players participating in Volume Wars. These are taken from BNB spent in attacks by all users who play the game.","Legendary NFT Stakers can collect their rewards using the claim button on the dashboard after the next season begins. Legendaries can be traded for BNB in our NFT makretplace."]}],[{"l":"Rewards","p":["Volume Wars has a dynamic reward structure designed to allow for future configuration by the community through a DAO proposal and vote system. Our initial proposeal is designed to provide sustainable rewards with a balanced incentive for adoption and works by taking fees from every attack.","This fee is broken down as following:","50% of the BNB spent on each attack is used to buy and then burn the attacking team's tokens.","Example: User selects Team A as his team, and attacks Team B. He submits the attack transaction, which spends some of his BNB. The Volume Wars smart contract uses 50% of the attack's BNB to buy Team A's token from Pancakeswap and immediately sends them to the burn address.","25% of the BNB from each attack is added to the Legendary NFT reward pool to be distributed at the beginning of the next season. These rewards are divided between the currently staked Legendary NFTs. IMPORTANT: You must have your LEGENDARY NFT staked before the start of the new season to be eligible to claim your rewards. Users may stake their legendary NFT to gain access to these rewards.","15% of the BNB from each attack is collected into a reward pool for the winning team. It should be noted that the use of these funds is to be determined by the project developers of the winning team. One of the following will apply, (1) buying and burning the tokens of the winning team, or (2) adding liquidity to the token's LP, and then burning the LP tokens.","10% of the Volume Wars BNB from each attack is used for platform development. This includes development costs and marketing, as well as referral bonuses."]}],[{"l":"Attack Tiers","p":["Attacks come in Tiers 1 to 4. The higher the size of the attack, the greater the cost, impact, and rewards.","A Tier 1 attack will yield a Tier 1 booster pack, and so on.","A higher tier booster pack gives you greater NFT rewards."]},{"l":"Probabilities","p":["Only tiers 2, 3 and 4 can potentially yield Rare NFTs. The exact rare chances for them are subject to change each season, and the information here may not reflect the latest values. The game UI itself will always show you the correct probabilies on the attack selection menu."]},{"l":"Tier 1","p":["No chance of Rares.","1 in 3 chance of minting 1 common NFT."]},{"l":"Tier 2","p":["1 in 250 chance of one Rare.","If no rare is minted, 1 in 2 chance of 1 common NFT."]},{"l":"Tier 3","p":["1 in 40 chance of one Rare.","If no rare is minted, it will yield 0 to 2 common NFTs."]},{"l":"Tier 4","p":["1 in 20 chance of one Rare.","If no rare is minted, it will yield 1 to 3 common NFTs."]},{"l":"Notes","p":["Only tier 4 guarantees you will receive a reward at all. All other tiers will often yield zero NFTs when unpacked, following the chances described above.","For example only 1 in 3 Tier 1 booster packs will contain a common. 2/3 Tier 1 booster packs contain nothing.","The likelyhood of receiving 0, 1 or 2 common NFTs from Tier 3 is the same.","The likelyhood of receiving 1, 2 or 3 common NFTs from Tier 4 is the same."]}],[{"l":"NFT Marketplace","p":["Volume Wars has its own native NFT marketplace that users may use to buy or sell. To list your NFT simply navigate to the NFT collection page and select sell, set your price and submit. Your NFT will be featured amongst those for sale and displayed for all other players in the order of lowest price available for that type of NFT.","Please note, because there is unlimited amount of common NFTs with no use cases yet (hint, hint) we decided to exclude them from being bought or sold at this time. Rest assured the developers are brainstorming new uses for common NFTs, and as these use cases are added we will be sure to add commons to the marketplace."]},{"l":"Marketplace Fee","p":["Volume Wars marketplace fee is currently set to 10% per each transaction. This fee is currently used to buy and burn Piggy Bank Tokens. This fee and its use may be subject to change in the future. The overall objective going forward is to allow the community to decide how this fee should be implemented with a governance mechanism, otherwise known as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). The implementation and timeline of this DAO is still under construction."]}],[{"l":"Links","p":["Audit Website Twitter"]}],[{"l":"Disclaimer","p":["ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF TERMS & CONDITIONS OF ACCESS","Use of the volumewars.app website, services, dapp, or application is subject to the following terms and conditions and I hereby confirm that by proceeding and interacting with the protocol I am aware of these and accept them in full:","Volumewars.app is a smart contract protocol in alpha stage of launch, and even though multiple security audits have been completed on the smart contracts, I understand the risks associated with using the Volume Wars protocol and associated functions.","Any interactions that I have with the associated Volume Wars protocol apps, smart contracts or any related functions MAY place my funds at risk, and I hereby release the Volume Wars protocol and its contributors, team members, and service providers from any and all liability associated with my use of the above-mentioned functions.","I am lawfully permitted to access this site and use the volumewars.app application functions, and I am not in contravention of any laws governing my jurisdiction of residence or citizenship."]}]]
