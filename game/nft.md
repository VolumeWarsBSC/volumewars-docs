# NFTs

Volume Wars rewards its participants with NFT Booster Packs, these can be claimed at the [NFT Locker](https://volumewars.app/#/locker)

After claiming these booster packs, users must unwrap the booster packs to mint their NFTs. These NFTs range from common to rare. 
There are 4 common cards and 3 rare cards to complete a set.

Players can play VolumeWars and attempt to collect a full set themselves or they can buy the missing NFTs to complete their set from a 3rd party marketplace.

Once a season's set is completed, it can be forged into a Legendary NFT.

#### NFT Staking
Legendary NFTs can be staked to collect BNB rewards generated by the other players participating in Volume Wars.
These are taken from BNB spent in attacks by all users who play the game. PLEASE NOTE: There is NO GAURANTEE of rewards, considering these rewards are dependant upon game activity. A complete loss of funds could be resulted from any failure of dependancies. 

Legendary NFT Stakers can collect their rewards using the claim button on the dashboard after the next season begins.
Legendaries can be traded for BNB in our NFT makretplace.
