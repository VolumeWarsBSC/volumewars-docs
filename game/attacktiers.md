# Attack Tiers

Attacks come in Tiers 1 to 4. The higher the size of the attack, the greater the cost, impact, and rewards.

A Tier 1 attack will yield a Tier 1 booster pack, and so on.

A higher tier booster pack gives you greater NFT rewards.

## Probabilities
**Only tiers 2, 3 and 4** can potentially yield *Rare* NFTs.
The exact rare chances for them are subject to change each season, and the information here may not reflect the latest values.
The game UI itself will **always** show you the correct probabilies on the attack selection menu.

### Tier 1
- **No chance** of Rares.
- **1 in 3 chance** of minting 1 common NFT.

### Tier 2
- **1 in 250 chance** of one Rare.
- If no rare is minted, **1 in 2 chance** of 1 common NFT.

### Tier 3
- **1 in 40 chance** of one Rare.
- If no rare is minted, it will yield **0 to 2** common NFTs.

### Tier 4
- **1 in 20 chance** of one Rare.
- If no rare is minted, it will yield **1 to 3** common NFTs.

## Notes

 - Only tier 4 guarantees you will receive a reward at all. All other tiers will often yield zero NFTs when unpacked, following the chances described above.

 - For example only 1 in 3 Tier 1 booster packs will contain a common. 2/3 Tier 1 booster packs contain nothing.
 - The likelyhood of receiving 0, 1 or 2 common NFTs from Tier 3 is the same.
 - The likelyhood of receiving 1, 2 or 3 common NFTs from Tier 4 is the same.
