# Rewards

Volume Wars has a dynamic reward structure designed to allow for future configuration to be shaped by the community with a DAO proposal and 
successful vote. Our initial proposed reward structure is designed to provide sustainable rewards with a balanced an incentive for adoption 
and works by taking fees from game activity on every attack. 

This fee is broken down as following: 

- 50% of the Volume Wars BNB from each attack is used to buy and then burn the tokens of the team they fight for. 

!!!
Example: User selects Team A as his team, and this user wants to attack Team B.  User attacks Team B and submits a transaction spending BNB, 
the Volume Wars smart contract buys the tokens from Team A using the Pancakeswap router contract and immediately sends them to the burn 
address. 50% of the attack BNB is used for this purpose. 
!!!

- 25% of the Volume Wars BNB from each attack is added to a Legendary NFT reward pool to be distributed at the end of each season.  BNB 
rewards are distributed relative to the amount of legendary NFTs eligible for rewards. Users may stake their legendary NFT to gain access 
to these rewards. 

- 15% of the Volume Wars BNB from each attack is collected into a pool to be used to reward the winning team. It should be noted that the 
use of these rewards are subject to be determined by the project developers of the winning team. Options include allowing these rewards to 
be used to buy and burn the tokens of the winning team, or to be paired as liquidity pool tokens and then burned.

- 10% of the Volume Wars BNB from each attack is used for development of the platform. This includes replenishing the chainlink tokens needed 
within the contract for the _FulfillRandomness_ function as well as continued platform developments and marketing etc.
