# Rewards

Volume Wars has a dynamic reward structure designed to allow for future configuration by the community through a DAO proposal and vote system.
Our initial proposeal is designed to provide sustainable rewards with a balanced incentive for adoption and works by taking fees from every attack.

This fee is broken down as following: 

- 50% of the BNB spent on each attack is used to buy and then burn the *attacking* team's tokens.

!!!
Example: User selects Team A as his team, and attacks Team B. He submits the attack transaction, which spends some of his BNB.
The Volume Wars smart contract uses 50% of the attack's BNB to buy Team A's token from Pancakeswap and immediately sends them to the burn address.
!!!

- 25% of the BNB from each attack is added to the Legendary NFT reward pool to be distributed at the beginning of the next season.
These rewards are divided between the currently staked Legendary NFTs.
Users may stake their legendary NFT to gain access to these rewards.

- 15% of the BNB from each attack is collected into a reward pool for the winning team.
It should be noted that the use of these funds is to be determined by the project developers of the winning team.
Possibilities include buying and burning the tokens of the winning team, or adding liquidity to the token's LP, and then burning the LP tokens.

- 10% of the Volume Wars BNB from each attack is used for platform development. This includes development costs and marketing, as well as referral bonuses.
