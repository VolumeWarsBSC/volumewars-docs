# NFT Marketplace

Volume Wars has its own native NFT marketplace that users may use to buy or sell. To list your NFT simply navigate 
to the NFT collection page and select sell, set your price and submit. Your NFT will be featured amongst those for 
sale and displayed for all other players in the order of lowest price available for that type of NFT. 

Please note, because there is unlimited amount of common NFTs with no use cases yet (hint, hint) we decided to exclude 
them from being bought or sold at this time. Rest assured the developers are brainstorming new uses for common NFTs, 
and as these use cases are added we will be sure to add commons to the marketplace.
