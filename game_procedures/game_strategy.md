# Gameplay Model
#### Fair Gameplay Strategy

Weighted teams wont matter. Fair gameplay with Volume Wars involves a mechanic in which the team with the LEAST amount 
of damage taken wins. This promotes healthy competition and here’s why:

=== Scenario one
A big project wants to dominate Volume Wars. They enter the game and their holder count is massive and 
start wrecking every other team. Now the other teams must combine attacks against the big player to stand a chance. 
This involves a coordinated effort between the ‘weaker’ projects to take down the big player.
===

=== Scenario two
This time two big players enter Volume Wars and decide they want to work together to destroy all of the 
other teams. In this scenario the weaker teams MUST coordinate strategy against the two big players. The weaker teams 
secretly agree to hold off on their attacks to fool the bigger teams into thinking that the weaker projects won’t even 
put up a fight. Eventually thinking they are much too far in the lead, the big teams start attacking each other. It 
is at the last minute the weak teams unleash fury and catch the big players off guard to tip the scales back in 
their direction.

#### Early Adopters Incentive
As mentioned in the game mechanics before, VolumeWars is designed to incentivize early adopters. Therefore:
- First users to participate will receive an increased chance at obtaining a **legendary NFT**. This percentage of odds will diminish over time.

- **Free entry** for token developers to become a featured project on Volume Wars to start. As volume Wars gains popularity there could be a fee upon entry.

- First participants will have the earliest opportunity to earn more BNB captured from the game because rewards is dependent on # of legendary NFTs staked
