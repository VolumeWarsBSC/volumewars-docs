# NFTs

Volume Wars rewards its participants with NFT Booster Packs, these can be claimed at the [NFT Locker](https://volumewars.app/#/locker)

After claiming these booster packs, users must unwrap the booster packs to mint their NFTs. These NFTs range from common to rare. 
There are 4 common cards and 3 rare cards to complete a set.

Players can play VolumeWars and attempt to collect the set themselves or they can buy the missing NFTs to complete their set from a 3rd party marketplace.

Once a complete set is made, the user can then choose to forge their set into a Legendary NFT.

#### NFT Staking
Legendary NFTs can be staked to collect BNB rewards generated by the other players participating in Volume Wars. These BNB rewards generated
are taken from fees per attack from all users who play the game.

Legendary NFTs Stakers can collect their rewards using the claim button on the dashboard after each season has concluded, and can buy and sell
their legendary NFT on our markplace.
