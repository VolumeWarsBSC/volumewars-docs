# Game Mechanics

Volume Wars is designed to provide the most rewards the early adopters. To achieve this we need to adjust the game 
variables using reward chance and prize pool percentage allocation. Currently these rewards are set at certain 
amounts, approximately 7.2 BNB per legendary, but this number will increase over time while remaining sensitive 
toward adoption of the protocol.

!!!primary
Remember, total rewards for legendary NFT holders is dependent on volume divided by the total legendary NFTs in 
circulation. Regarding this, our long term planning is to set our variables that allow for at least 1 legendary 
NFT to be minted per season. Of course this proposition is subjective towards seasonal volume as these NFTs are 
dropped based upon BNB spent. So starting out we have implemented a percentage decrease in the odds to obtain a 
legendary NFT as adjusted weekly and influenced by protocol volume.

_Note that each season is open for a period of one week._

#### Examples

If 25 BNB volume per week then then chance to obtain a legendary decrease by 50% the current rate every week until it is only possible to obtain 1 legendary NFT dropped during the season.

+++ Week 1
1:20 odds per rare dropped @ 0.12 BNB per attack
+++ Week 2 
1:30 odds per rare dropped @ 0.12 BNB per attack
+++ Week 3
1:45 odds per rare dropped @ 0.12 BNB per attack
+++ Week 4
1:68 odds per rare dropped @ 0.12 BNB per attack
+++ ...
_etc..._
+++

If 50 BNB volume per week then chance to obtain a legendary decreases by 40% the current rate every week until it is only possible to obtain 1 legendary NFT dropped during the season.

+++ Week 1
1:20 odds per rare dropped @ 0.12 BNB per attack
+++ Week 2
1:28 odds per rare dropped @ 0.12 BNB per attack
+++ Week 3
1:39 odds per rare dropped @ 0.12 BNB per attack
+++ Week 4
1:55 odds per rare dropped @ 0.12 BNB per attack
+++ ...
_etc..._
+++

If 100 BNB volume per week then chance to obtain a legendary decreases by 20% the current rate every week until it is only possible to obtain 1 legendary NFT dropped during the season.

+++ Week 1
1:20 odds per rare dropped @ 0.12 BNB per attack
+++ Week 2
1:24 odds per rare dropped @ 0.12 BNB per attack
+++ Week 3
1:29 odds per rare dropped @ 0.12 BNB per attack
+++ Week 4
1:34 odds per rare dropped @ 0.12 BNB per attack
+++ ...
_etc..._
+++

If more than 100 BNB volume per week then chance to obtain a legendary decrease by 10% the current rate every week until it is only possible to obtain 1 legendary NFT dropped during the season.

+++ Week 1
1:20 odds per rare dropped @ 0.12 BNB per attack
+++ Week 2
1:22 odds per rare dropped @ 0.12 BNB per attack
+++ Week 3
1:24 odds per rare dropped @ 0.12 BNB per attack
+++ Week 4
1:27 odds per rare dropped @ 0.12 BNB per attack
+++ ...
_etc..._

!!!Primary
It is possible that the sudden change in volume from week to week could influence our decision to increase or decrease
 the rewards as necessary. We aim to hand this power over to a DAO in the future.
