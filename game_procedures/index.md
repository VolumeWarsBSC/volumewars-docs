# The Game

=== 1. Choose a team/project
Upon navigating to https://volumewars.app, the first step will be to join your team. It is important to understand 
that each team on volume wars is a project with their own token on Binance Smart Chain. Note that you there is no 
requirement to join any team, but after your selection you will not be able to switch teams, so choose wisely! 
A team selection will require a small amount of gas to complete a one-time transaction.

=== 2. Attack any other team to gain experience points and add damage points on to that team
Now for the fun part. To attack a team, the user must select both the opposing team for a target as well as the 
amount of damage points to be used for the attack. More damage points cost more BNB to attack, however higher 
damage also yields a higher percentage of chance for reward as well as additional experience points earned. 
Upon attack completion, the user will be awarded 1 booster pack.

=== 3. Receive booster packs which contain unique collectable rare and common NFTs
As described previously, higher damage yields higher rewards generated as booster packs. Booster packs are unique 
to volume wars and contain one of several substrate NFTs that, when combined together, allow the user to obtain 
BNB captured within the game. The opportunity to collect and trade these NFTs within the ecosystem to complete 
the set is the overall objective to fully capture this value potential within Volume Wars.

=== 4. Unwrap your booster packs and retrieve your NFTs
Volume Wars booster packs use Chainlink VRF by calling function fulfillRandomness yielding a random number from 
the smart contract. This random number is indicative of the players chance at receiving 1 of 3 rare NFTs. 
Chainlink VRF is widely considered as an industry standard in randomness on the blockchain. You can read 
more about it on their website at https://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-vrf/. Note that there NFTs are 
limited by season, and there can only be a collection of 4 common NFTs and 3 rare NFTs per season. This 
means that as soon as the season is closed, there will be no more NFTs granted from participation for 
that season. This limits the amount of NFTs that can be forged into a legendary NFT per season.

=== 5. Forge the the NFT set into a legendary NFT to collect your rewards.
If you are lucky enough to get all 7 of the NFTs, you can now forge your legendary! Forging a legendary takes 
the set of 7 NFTs and burns them to mint one legendary which allows the user to claim the rewards by staking 
this legendary on our UI to capture these rewards generated each season.

!!!warning
IMPORTANT: NFTs MUST BE FROM THE SAME SEASON TO MINT A LEGENDARY, YOU CANNOT MIX NFTS ACROSS MULTIPLE SEASONS 
TO MINT A LEGENDARY.
