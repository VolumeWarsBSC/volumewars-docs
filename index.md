Welcome to Volume Wars documentations, here you will learn everything about Volume Wars.

#### Abstract
Volume Wars allows any user to pick a project on the BNB chain, any project that has integrated with our platform, 
and attack other projects in a fun trading competition. Users participate by buying their projects’ token 
and sending it to the burn address. Gain experience points, NFTs and do damage on the blockchain to opposing 
projects to compete for the prize top prize, a massive buy-back and burn for any project that wins. Fun, 
friendly and fair competitions that benefit every project that uses it.

#### What is VolumeWars?
Volume Wars has been created as a solution for a growing problem, competition between projects on the blockchain.

Our task was to create a game that would bring thousands of competing DeFi tokens together, channeling the strength of their communities into a battle for volume, boosting volume and price action for all participants.

DeFi tokens are special and unique in that they have something called the magic of tokenomics. 
Volume Wars is THE game to motivate those tokenomics and benefit all of DeFi as a whole. #LiftingUp

#### Calling all volume!

_“Give me volume or give me paper hands”_ — degens

So why exactly did we call it **VOLUME** wars, and why is volume so important? In order to understand this question,
we first need to back up and ask what are tokenomics?

The magic of DeFi uses a suite of services via ‘tokenomics’ 
that actuate during the events of volume. In simple terms, with every buy, sell, transfer and borrow/lend each of 
these events stand to generate an amount of volume that is then subjected to a protocol fee.

This protocol fee 
is the mechanism used to carry over rewards towards protocol growth and sustainability as an incentive for holders. 
Therefore the following inevitably applies throughout DeFi:

NO volume = NO tokenomics = Slow death spiral
